# planet-graph

<h2>Todo:<h2>

- stop blindly using gpt outputs
- create central top-down view, with left/right side views
- use logarithmic scaling to create more space between inner orbits
- add thin lines to show past orbit positions for each planet
- add moons
- add other celestial bodies of significant size (dwarf planets, large asteroids, comets)
- add detail views for bodies with moons
- render bodies in 3d and show rotational axis
- allow user input to change date
